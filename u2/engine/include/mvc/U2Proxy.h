* A <code>Proxy</code> might simply manage a reference to a local data object,

* <code>Proxy</code> classes are also used to encapsulate the application's
* interaction with remote services to save or retrieve data, in which case,
* we adopt an asyncronous idiom; setting data (or calling a method) on the
* <code>Proxy</code> and listening for a <code>Notification</code> to be sent
* when the <code>Proxy</code> has retrieved the data from the service. </P>

    into anybody who includes it. This is needed for the
    Singleton template to work, but we actually only want it
    compiled into the implementation of the class based on the

    link errors when trying to use the Singleton-based class from
    an outside dll.

    This method just delegates to the template version anyway,
    but the implementation stays in this single compilation unit,
    preventing link errors.
